redux-101.js
- the createStore() function works like: 
  this.setState((preState)=> {
    return preState
  }) --- IT SET ITSELF BACK TO THE SAME THING, DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
  SO, everytime when the switch statement returns the default value
  the state is set over and over again, therefore, you can't set 
  state.count - this would overwrite the state object into undefined.
